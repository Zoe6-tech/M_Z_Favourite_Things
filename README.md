This app includes 3 of my favourite things, which are all animes. If you feel interested, please don't hesitate to visit. `Click images in app  will help you gain more information about animes.`<br />
[Project Roadmap](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19yKH5ZlCC6yool7dJxyqPO2xrMJR74GXJphSaDuTTAs/edit?usp=sharing) is here.

## Description
1. Pick 3 things you love and create an app that showcases those things. 
2. Design a database that contains at least 4 columns - you must include an image of some kind and descriptive
data about each of those things. 
3. Use the class authoring files as a reference - however DO NOT use the design files - make something better.

## Assignment Requirements:
1. Design a mobile-first one page web application that highlights your favourite things. 
2. Use images, video, 3D - anything at all. You must have a  database with at least 4 columns - you MUST have title / heading (text), image(s) and descriptive text. 
3. Include a landing / splash page with some controls to showcase each of your favourite things. 
4. You should also include some kind of error handling if things go awry. Use modern tools and techniques to generate the required assets. Use SASS components for your CSS and JS components where appropriate.
